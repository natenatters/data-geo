THE PEOPLE OF THE 1650 PLAN
============================

Research compiled February 2026.


THE TOWN
--------

Manchester in the 1650s was a market town of perhaps 5,000 people — a
place you could walk across in ten minutes. The Collegiate Church (now
the Cathedral) dominated the skyline. A handful of streets radiated
outward: Deansgate tracing the old Roman road south, Long Millgate
curving north along the River Irk, Market Place where the weekly market
had been held since the charter of 1301. Open fields pressed in on every
side. The rivers Irwell and Irk were wider than some of the streets.

This was a cloth town. Not cotton — that comes a century later — but
linen and wool, and especially fustian, a hard-wearing linen-cotton
blend that was Manchester's first industry. The "putting-out" system
was in full swing: wealthy merchants supplied raw materials to weavers
who worked at home on hand looms, then collected the finished cloth for
sale at market or export to London. It was a town of middlemen, traders,
and craftsmen — not yet a town of factories.

The 1650 plan may be the oldest surviving picture of Manchester. It
shows a place that barely qualifies as a town by modern standards. About
24 streets. No walls. No castle (the old baronial hall had long since
decayed). Just a church, a market, a river crossing, and a few hundred
houses packed tightly together with gardens and orchards behind them.


HUMPHREY CHETHAM (1580-1653)
----------------------------

The most important person walking these streets in 1650 was Humphrey
Chetham — textile merchant, moneylender, and the man who would become
Manchester's greatest benefactor.

Chetham was born in Crumpsall in 1580 to a family of modest yeoman
farmers. He was apprenticed at age 14 to a Manchester linen draper and
built himself into one of the wealthiest men in Lancashire through the
cloth trade, especially fustian. He became a major creditor — lending
money to other merchants and to the gentry, who were perpetually short
of cash. He served as High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1635.

He never married. He lived simply despite his wealth, lodging in rooms
in the town rather than building a grand house. When the Civil War came,
Chetham tried to stay neutral — difficult in a town that had declared
for Parliament. He served as a tax collector for the Parliamentary side,
though apparently with little enthusiasm.

When Chetham died in September 1653, his will revealed extraordinary
generosity. He left his fortune to found two institutions:

  Chetham's Hospital — a school for "the sons of honest, industrious
  and painful parents" (meaning hardworking, not suffering). Forty boys
  were to be housed, fed, clothed, and educated. The school still
  exists today as Chetham's School of Music.

  Chetham's Library — the oldest free public reference library in the
  English-speaking world, founded 1653, still operating from the same
  medieval building beside the Cathedral. Chetham specified that the
  library should be open to "all scholars and others well affected" —
  free to anyone who walked in.

The building Chetham chose for both was the medieval college of priests
next to the Collegiate Church — it sits right at the heart of the 1650
plan. Two centuries later, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels would sit at
a desk in Chetham's Library reading room, researching what became The
Communist Manifesto. The alcove where they worked is still preserved.


THE STANLEYS — LORDS OF THE MANOR
----------------------------------

The Stanley family, Earls of Derby, had been lords of the manor of
Manchester since the 1400s. By the 1640s the lord was James Stanley,
Lord Strange, later 7th Earl of Derby — a committed Royalist and one
of the most powerful men in the north of England.

In September 1642, Lord Strange marched on Manchester with a force of
several thousand men and demanded the town's surrender. Manchester
refused. What happened next was one of the first armed confrontations
of the English Civil War.

The townspeople — weavers, dyers, merchants, labourers — threw up
earthwork barricades across the street ends. They had no walls, no
professional soldiers, no artillery to speak of. Strange's forces
besieged the town for two days, setting fire to houses on the outskirts
and bombarding the centre. Manchester held. Strange withdrew.

The 1650 plan may have been drawn in connection with these defences —
a military survey of a town that suddenly needed to know its own
geography. The barricades would have been placed across the very streets
visible on the plan: the end of Deansgate, the approaches to Market
Place, the bridge over the Irwell.

Lord Strange fought on for the King. After the Royalist defeat, he was
captured following the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He was tried by
court martial and beheaded in Bolton on 15 October 1651. His wife,
Charlotte de la Tremoille, had famously defended Lathom House in
Lancashire against a Parliamentary siege for months — one of the great
siege stories of the war.

The Stanleys lost effective control of Manchester after the war. The
town had defied its lord and won. It would increasingly govern itself
through the Court Leet, run by local merchants and tradesmen rather
than distant aristocrats.


THE MOSLEY FAMILY
-----------------

If the Stanleys were the absentee lords, the Mosleys were the resident
gentry — the family who actually lived in and around Manchester and
wielded day-to-day influence.

Sir Edward Mosley held the sub-manor of Manchester and owned extensive
land around the town, including Ancoats Hall to the east. The Mosleys
had been prominent since the early 1500s. They were lawyers, landowners,
and officeholders — the kind of family who sat on every committee,
served as justices of the peace, and controlled local appointments.

During the Civil War, the Mosleys managed the difficult trick of
staying roughly aligned with Parliament without fully alienating the
Royalist establishment. This political flexibility kept them in power
locally after the war, when many Royalist gentry lost their estates.

Mosley Street — one of Manchester's main streets today, running from
Piccadilly toward St Peter's Square — is named for this family. Their
influence in Manchester lasted well into the 18th century.


THE DEFENDERS OF 1642
---------------------

The siege of Manchester in September 1642 was fought not by soldiers but
by ordinary townspeople. The town had no garrison. When Lord Strange's
army appeared, it was the constables, the weavers, the dyers, and the
shopkeepers who built the barricades and manned them.

Richard Martinscroft was one of the constables who organised the
defence. The boroughreeve (the town's chief officer) and the constables
rallied the townspeople, distributed what weapons they had — mostly
farm tools, hunting weapons, and a few muskets — and directed the
building of earthwork defences across the street ends.

The siege lasted from 24 to 26 September 1642. Strange's forces burned
houses on the outskirts, fired into the town, and attempted to storm
the barricades. They failed. After two days, with casualties mounting
and no breakthrough, Strange withdrew. It was a humiliation for one of
the most powerful lords in the north and an extraordinary moment of
collective defiance by an unfortified market town.

Manchester would remain a Parliamentarian stronghold throughout the
war. The experience of the siege — of ordinary people defending their
town against their own lord — shaped the town's identity. Manchester
was a town that governed itself, that didn't defer to aristocratic
authority. That spirit of independence would serve it well a century
later, when the same merchant families would drive the Industrial
Revolution.


THE WEAVERS AND FUSTIAN TRADERS
-------------------------------

Most of the ~5,000 people on the 1650 plan were involved in the textile
trade in some way. Manchester's economy revolved around cloth — not the
fine wool of the Cotswolds or East Anglia, but coarser fabrics: linen,
wool, and above all fustian.

Fustian was a hard-wearing fabric with a linen warp and cotton weft. It
was Manchester's speciality from at least the 1500s. The cotton came
from the Levant (modern Turkey and Syria), imported through London, and
was distributed to weavers across Lancashire by Manchester merchants.

The putting-out system worked like this: a merchant (like Chetham) would
buy raw materials — flax, yarn, cotton — and distribute them to weavers
working in cottages in the town and surrounding villages. The weavers
would produce cloth on hand looms, then return it to the merchant, who
would sell it at market or ship it to London. The merchant controlled
the capital; the weaver provided the labour.

Market day — held in Market Place, visible at the centre of the plan —
was when the town came alive. Cloth was the main trade, but the market
also supplied food, livestock, ironmongery, and household goods to the
surrounding countryside. Manchester had held its market charter since
1301 and it was the commercial heart of south-east Lancashire.

The great-grandchildren of these weavers would still be weaving in the
1740s, when Berry published his map. Their great-great-grandchildren
would be the first generation to move from cottage looms to factory
floors.


JOHN BERRY'S ANCESTORS?
------------------------

John Berry, who published the famous 1741 plan of Manchester, was a
"merchant grocer" but also variously a watchmaker, auctioneer, and
printer. That kind of multi-trade merchant-tradesman was exactly the
type that populated 1650s Manchester.

We don't have Berry's genealogy, but the Berry surname appears in
Manchester parish records from the early 1600s. It is entirely
plausible that Berry's grandfather or great-grandfather was one of the
people living on the 1650 plan — perhaps a weaver or small trader,
perhaps one of the men who stood behind the barricades in 1642.

Berry included the c. 1650 plan as a small inset on his own 1741 map,
in the lower left corner. It was a deliberate act of historical memory:
here is the town your grandparents knew, and here is what it has become.
The inset allowed viewers to compare the ~24 streets of 1650 with the
~160 streets of 1741 — a century of growth made visible at a glance.

Whether Berry knew his own family had walked those earlier streets, we
cannot say. But in a town of 5,000 people where everyone knew everyone,
and where families stayed for generations, the odds are good.


WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
------------------

The people of the 1650 plan lived through extraordinary times. The
Civil War, the execution of Charles I (1649), Cromwell's Commonwealth,
the Restoration of Charles II (1660), the Glorious Revolution (1688).
But Manchester itself changed slowly. By 1700 the population was still
only about 8,000-10,000.

The real transformation was still a century away. Between 1650 and 1741
(when Berry published his map), Manchester roughly tripled in size —
from 5,000 to 18,000. Between 1741 and 1794 (when Green published his
map), it nearly tripled again to 50,000. And by 1851 it had exploded
to over 300,000.

But in the 1650s, all of that was unimaginable. The people on this plan
knew a small, self-contained market town where the church bell marked
the hours, the river powered a few corn mills, and the weekly market
was the most exciting event in the calendar. They could not have
dreamed that their tiny town would become the first industrial city
on earth.
