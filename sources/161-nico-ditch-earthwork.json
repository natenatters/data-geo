  "description": "A 6-mile (9.7km) linear earthwork running from Ashton-under-Lyne to Stretford, passing through Denton, Reddish, Gorton, Levenshulme, Burnage, Rusholme, Platt Fields, Withington, and Chorlton-cum-Hardy. 4-5 yards wide, up to 5 feet deep. U-shaped profile suggests a boundary marker rather than military defence. Possibly a Mercian-Northumbrian boundary. Still visible in sections.",
