  "description": "Earliest known plan of Manchester, drawn during the English Civil War when the town was besieged by Royalist forces in 1642. Manchester was a Parliamentarian stronghold — the townspeople built earthwork defences and held off Lord Strange's army for two days. The plan shows a tiny medieval settlement: the Collegiate Church, a handful of streets (Deansgate, Market Place, Long Millgate), and open countryside on all sides. Survives only as an inset on later Casson & Berry maps (source 9). This is Manchester before everything — before the canals, before cotton, before industry. A market town of perhaps 5,000 people that would become the first industrial city on earth.",

  "notes": "Not a standalone original — survives only as a small inset in the corner of the Casson & Berry maps (source 9, 1741-57). Georeferenced separately in AllMaps by masking just the inset.\n\n--- THE EARLIEST MAP ---\n\nThis is the oldest known picture of Manchester. Drawn around 1650, during or just after the English Civil War, it shows a place that barely qualifies as a town. The Collegiate Church (now the Cathedral) dominates — the largest building by far, surrounded by a churchyard. A handful of streets radiate outward: Deansgate running south, Long Millgate curving north along the Irk, Market Place where the weekly market had been held since the charter of 1301.\n\nIn 1642, Manchester had chosen the wrong side — or the right one, depending on your politics. When Lord Strange marched on the town with a Royalist army, demanding its surrender, the townspeople refused. They threw up earthwork defences across the street ends and fought for two days. Strange's forces fired the houses on the outskirts and bombarded the town, but Manchester held. It was one of the first acts of armed resistance in the Civil War.\n\nThe plan may have been drawn in connection with these defences — a military survey of a town that suddenly needed to know its own geography. What it shows is startling in its smallness. You could fit the entire settlement inside a modern football stadium's car park. Open fields press in on every side. The rivers Irwell and Irk are wider than some of the streets.\n\nBerry included this plan as an inset on his 1741 map, a century later. By then Manchester had grown, but not unrecognisably. The same streets, the same church, the same rivers. It would take another century — the forty years between Berry (1750) and Green (1794) — before the town exploded beyond all recognition.\n\nThree maps, three Manchesters: 1650 (5,000 people), 1750 (18,000), 1794 (50,000).
