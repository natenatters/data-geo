  "description": "Eighteenth-century map with decorative oak leaf borders and corner shells, featuring eighteen views, inset of 1650 plan, southwestern prospect, and architectural illustrations. Shows Manchester as a compact market town of ~18,000 people, walkable edge to edge in fifteen minutes. The Collegiate Church sits at the centre, Deansgate traces the old Roman road south, and Market Place is still an open square. The Irwell, Irk, and Medlock flow through open meadows. Berry published five editions (1741-57) with barely any changes — the town was sleeping, a decade before the Bridgewater Canal and the Industrial Revolution would transform it utterly. Compare with Green's Plan (source 11, 1787-94) to see forty years of explosive growth.",

  "notes": "Third edition (1746), engraved by B. Cole, printed by Palmer & Howe.\nPhysical size: 604mm x 1006mm. 5 known editions: 1741, 1745, 1746, 1750/51, 1757.\nDecorative oak leaf borders, corner shells, 18 views of buildings, inset of 1650 plan.\n\n--- BERRY'S MANCHESTER ---\n\nIn 1741, a surveyor named R. Casson and an engraver named John Berry walked the streets of Manchester and drew what they saw. It wasn't much, by the standards of what it would become. A compact market town of perhaps 18,000 souls, huddled where the rivers Irwell and Irk met. You could walk from one edge to the other in fifteen minutes.\n\nThe Collegiate Church (now the Cathedral) sat at the centre of gravity. Deansgate — literally the road to the Dean's gate — ran south from it, the same path the Romans had trodden 1,600 years before when they marched to Mamucium. Market Place was exactly that: an open square where farmers from the surrounding townships sold wool and linen.\n\nThe Irwell curved gently around the west side of town, crossed by a single medieval stone bridge into Salford. The Irk came down from the north through open fields. The Medlock wound through meadows to the south. Between them, Manchester was a small, legible thing — a few streets of timber-framed buildings, a handful of churches, a grammar school, a few gentlemen's houses with gardens running down to the riverbank.\n\nBerry published five editions between 1741 and 1757. The town barely changed between them. He could afford to reuse the same copper plate, updating only the vignettes around the edges. The little inset of the 1650 plan — the Civil War-era town — looked remarkably similar to the town Berry was drawing a century later. Manchester had been sleeping.\n\nIt was about to wake up.\n\nCompare with Green's Plan (source 11, 1787-94) to see the forty years of explosive growth that followed — the Bridgewater Canal (1761), the Spinning Jenny (1764), the first steam-powered cotton mills (1781), and a population that tripled to 50,000.\n\nUoM Digital Collections IIIF (1746 edition, 6500x4063px, capped at 2000px output):\nhttps://www.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/iiif/PR-C-00017-00070-MANCHESTER-00057\nhttps://image.digitalcollections.manchester.ac.uk/iiif/PR-C-00017-00070-MANCHESTER-00057-000-00001.jp2\n\nUoM LUNA IIIF (same 1746 scan, FULL resolution access, 6500x4063px):\nhttps://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/maps002~1~1~415398~232468/full/full/0/default.jpg\nInfo: https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/maps002~1~1~415398~232468/info.json\nManifest: https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/maps002~1~1~415398~232468/manifest\nViewer: https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps002~1~1~415398~232468\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
