  "description": "Mamucium was never a destination \u2014 it was a four-road junction where the Chester-York route (Margary 7a/712) crossed the roads to Ribchester (7b) and Wigan (702). Agricola built the fort around 79 AD to hold the Pennine crossing through Brigantian territory. In 197, after civil war stripped Britain of troops, emergency detachments of Noricans and Raetians were shipped from Austria to rebuild the gate \u2014 damage control, not investment. By 250 the civilian vicus was dead (confirmed by the 2001-05 UMAU excavations). By 340 the last coins were dropped and the garrison ended. Manchester is absent from the Notitia Dignitatum (~395-425) \u2014 it wasn't even considered a functioning garrison anymore. Meanwhile Lancaster got massive refortification and Ribchester kept its Sarmatian cavalry to the end. The Romans looked at Manchester's geography \u2014 small rivers, no port, a pass through the hills \u2014 and saw a problem to be managed, not a place to invest.",
