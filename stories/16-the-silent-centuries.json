  "description": "Five hundred years with no written record \u2014 but not five hundred years of peace. A volcanic winter darkened the sky in 536. The Justinianic Plague swept through in 549. \u00c6thelfrith\u2019s army almost certainly marched through the ruins of Mamucium on its way to slaughter 1,200 monks at Chester in 616. The Great Plague ravaged the region in 664 \u2014 Bede says it swept Northumbria 'far and near.' A cattle murrain in 699-701 collapsed the pastoral economy. Manchester sat on the Mercian-Northumbrian border (the Ribble), changing overlords with every coup \u2014 and Northumbria had ten kings in seventy years, three murdered, five expelled. Then the Norse arrived: expelled from Dublin in 902, they flooded Lancashire, leaving place-names (Formby, Crosby, Toxteth) and the Cuerdale Hoard \u2014 8,600 items, 31kg of silver, deposited near Preston on the old frontier. In 919, Edward the Elder finally fortified 'Mameceastre in Northhymbrum' as a frontier post against the Norse kingdom of York. The silence was never empty.",
